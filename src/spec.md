# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the current Valentine proposal flow with a single-page, dreamy Rose Day dedication website for Ashvena featuring a rose-filled backdrop, gentle romantic animations, interactive clickable roses with love messages, and optional background music.

**Planned changes:**
- Swap the existing Valentine proposal experience for a single Rose Day landing page with the hero heading exactly: "🌹 Happy Rose Day, My Love Ashvena 🌹".
- Add a realistic “hundreds of roses” background (red/pink/white) with a soft pastel glow overlay, plus a continuous falling roses/petals animation layer across the full page.
- Create an “Interactive Roses” section with multiple clickable rose elements; clicking reveals a short sweet message, and repeated clicks cycle (or deterministically rotate) through that rose’s available messages, including: “I love you Jnu ❤️”, “You are my favorite rose 🌹”, “Forever yours, Ashvena”, “My heart blooms for you”, “Every rose reminds me of you”, “You are my always”, “One rose, endless love”.
- Add a highlighted “Special Love” message box displaying exactly: "Ashvena, just like roses, my love for you grows more beautiful every day. Happy Rose Day, my Jnu ❤️"
- Add extra romantic visuals: floating hearts, sparkles, and a soft glow hover effect on roses; include a closing section with exactly: "This garden of roses is only for you, Ashvena 🌹"
- Use elegant cursive typography for headings/love messages (with readable fallbacks) and update the document title to reference Rose Day and/or Ashvena.
- Add optional calm romantic background music with a user-controlled play/pause toggle that does not autoplay.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see a soft, romantic Rose Day page dedicated to Ashvena with a realistic rose garden background, falling rose/petal animation, clickable roses that reveal rotating love messages, decorative hearts/sparkles, a highlighted dedication message, a closing line, and an optional play/pause music control.
