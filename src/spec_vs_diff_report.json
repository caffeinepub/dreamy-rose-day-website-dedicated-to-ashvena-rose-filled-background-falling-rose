  "summary": "Most requested Rose Day UI elements are implemented: single-page RoseDay route, exact hero heading, rose-garden background with glow overlay, falling roses, sparkles, floating hearts, highlighted dedication box, closing line, cursive typography + updated HTML title, and a user-controlled music toggle. One key interaction detail is missing: per-rose message cycling on repeated clicks. There is also an apparent violation of the 'immutable paths must not be edited' constraint (useInternetIdentity.ts was modified).",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Repeated clicks on a rose should cycle through available messages for that rose (or deterministically show another message per-rose), not just toggle the same message.",
      "reason": "InteractiveRosesSection assigns a single fixed message per rose at initialization and the click handler only toggles `revealed` true/false; there is no logic to change/cycle the message on repeated clicks.",
